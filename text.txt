The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible multiple fruit
 consisting of coalesced berries, also called pineapples,[2][3] and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4]

Pineapples may be cultivated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit,[2][5] possibly flowering in five to ten months and fruiting 
in the following six months.[5][6] Pineapples do not ripen significantly after harvest.[7] In 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, and the Philippines accounted 
for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.
